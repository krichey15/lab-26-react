Run the command below to set up REACT server.

npm install --save webpack webpack-dev-server html-webpack-plugin node-sass sass-loader  resolve-url-loader css-loader extract-text-webpack-plugin babel-core babel-loader babel-preset-react babel-preset-env babel-plugin-transform-object-rest-spread react react-dom

using "npm run watch" will show you the cowsay project.

I used faker.hacker.phrase to change what the cow is saying each time the button is clicked. I am also randomizing the Cow displayed every time the button is clicked.
